\description{
HDF5 Groups are represented by the H5Group class and are the building blocks
of the hierarchical organization of an H5File. They form containers for 
HDF5 objects and are therefore similar to file system folders.
}
\details{
In addition to Group--specific capabilities listed below H5Group 
shares common functionality with H5File through the CommonFG base class.
